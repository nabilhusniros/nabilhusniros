A data-driven detective with a passion for quality, I'm a Software Tester in the making, currently sharpening my skills in software testing. Though projects are pending (watch this space!), I'm actively seeking opportunities to learn, collaborate, and hone my craft. Eager to build a career uncovering hidden bugs and ensuring a seamless user experience, I'm excited to join the vibrant testing community and contribute my analytical eye and dedication to excellence.
